The basis of this course in a nutshell: _to create better scientific or engineering visualizations_.

If we consider looking at typical scientific- or engineering-based plot going to be put in a journal publication or web article, we will want that imagery to be easily understandable, represent the data accurately, and remove any unwanted distrations that may misrepresent the data or confuse the user/reader. Typically, this involves a process as follows:

# Python Visualization Packages

## Seaborn

## Others

But, enhancing our plotting capabilities through the appearance of visualizations only go so far. They are still considered static imagery.

The basics of this lecture is creating better plots. First, we can enhance our plotting capabilities through styles by using different packages such as the seaborn package. But, those are still static plots that one cannot interact with. As scientists or engineers, or just even curious humans, we might want to __interact__ with the data itself rather than go through this whole routine of get data, visualize it, edit scripts, visualize again. What if we could visualize the data once and then interact with the data/plot to get the "view" we want for publications?
