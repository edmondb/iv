The basics of this lecture is creating better plots. First, we can enhance our plotting capabilities through styles by using different packages such as the seaborn package. But, those are still static plots that one cannot interact with. As scientists or engineers, or just even curious humans, we might want to __interact__ with the data itself rather than go through this whole routine of get data, visualize it, edit scripts, visualize again. What if we could visualize the data once and then interact with the data/plot to get the "view" we want for publications?
